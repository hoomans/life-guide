# Life guide for hoomans

This is a basic guide to life as a hooman being. Schools don't seem to teach it, and I think parents just expect the schools to teach it and so don't bother. Or they wait until their kid is a teenager but by then the kid either hates them or doesn't take well to advice anymore. Or the parents simply don't know this stuff themselves, and there is a kind of an endless loop of not knowing.

### Social Basics

While there are going to be rules you should realise that as you get to know a person better the social rules can change for that relationship. Pretend there are a base level of rules that you initially abide by, but as the relationship moves on you can rewrite the rules. 

For example, calling someone stupid or fat is banned in the initial rule set, but over time you may become close friends with this person and both affectionately call each other names like "stupid" and "fat". This usually only works when it is obvious you don't think of each other as "stupid" or "fat". In general, even if you are good friends, only call someone "stupid" when they are obviously smart, or "fat" when they are obviously not fat. 

### One on one conversing with aquaintances 

When conversing realise two things:

- there is no objective reality
- you can steer the conversation

"there is no objective reality" - this is a topic in itself, but in regard to conversations it means things don't really exist until hoomans bring them to life by focusing on them. Therefore you should focus on good thing rather than bad. Gossip (talking about other hoomans) can especially dangerous and only should be done with close friends.

"you can steer the conversation" - obvious really. Steer the conversation away from negative areas like bad gossip towards good areas. 

Example:
A = you
B = coworker

A - hi
B - hi
A - What's been happening?
B - I just got out of a meeting. Geez John is a dick.
A - Ohh why?
B - He cut over me while I was speaking. Twice. That guy is such a douchebag.

Option 1: Continue on negative area
A - God he does sound shitty. I think I saw him doing that the other day as well. Wendy does it too.

Option 2: Steer out of negative area
A - Haha damn yeah he does that sometimes. Get up to much over the weekend?

Also steer towards making jokes - this will make a big impact over time. People will associate you with positivity and laughter. You don't have to be annoyingly positive. Don't actually say "this topic is really negative, can we change it?". Or "stop talking about negative things", which is a command and should be avoided (I'll discuss later). Do it subtly. Do it without anyone noticing. 

#### Guy groups

Guy groups can enter this weird gray area of name calling that passes as banter (banter meaning just joking around). It's often the more testosterone filled guy groups that do this - and your ability to defend yourself and call people names back becomes some kind of test of strength. Weirdly, girls can do a much subtler version when first meeting guys, to test the same thing: is there any fire behind this guy (or, biologically speaking: would he be able to look after me and my children?).

Nerds and outcasts at school can have a tough time with this, and often see it as ridiculous and below them. But I believe you should foster a reasonable level of skill at this. Practice ribbing your current friends every so often. It should come naturally - beat them at video games and rub it in a little. Be slightly competitive every so often. Guys are naturally good at not making it personal but sometimes it can slip into that area. A good rule of thumb is to watch how much others are dishing it out - if someone is dishing out a lot then they are ripe to rib a little. Someone that is copping a lot of ribbing and not taking it well is obviously someone you should defend - not rib more. 

Some may disagree with this and say you should never rib anyone but I think it's silly to ignore biology. I'm not advising saying hurtful things - I'm saying learn to "banter" - learn how to respond to the low level ribbing. If someone calls you a "gay cunt" straight off the bat then of course I suggest you leave that group. I'm talking more like the sarcastic "nice catch", when another guy drops something.

Overview:

- banter at low levels is normal - practice it with your friends to help you slip more easily into other social circles
- it's basically showing you have a toughness about you - you respect yourself
- girls will also test your ability to stick up for yourself in very subtle ways (read: you won't know they are doing it) - so this banter helps out in the dating game too

#### One on one with girls

- avoid talking about physical appearance, even if they bring it up

If a female hooman brings up physical appearance, eg by asking your thoughts on how another female hooman looks, always either say something positive and change subject, or change subject immediately. The subject of appearance with females (and males) mostly is pointless and contributes to unnecessary pressure on people about their looks. 

A lot of men usually work this one out early, but it has to be said. Unfortunately females themselves are just as bad, if not worse. If a female puts a good picture of herself on Facebook - it's usually not the guys who focus on the looks, but actually girls who say things like "Hot!", "total babe xox", etc: not realising that this is saying "we take notice of your looks". If you're reading this girls, remember that by saying a girl is hot is also conveying that you think looks matter. There is no objective reality - you're creating a reality in which looks matter more!

Work in progress.
